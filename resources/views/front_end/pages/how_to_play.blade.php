                         You’ll be given a virtual budget (e.g., 100 million currency) to spend on players. Each
                         player is priced based on their performance, popularity, and potential.

                        You can make transfers each week to strengthen your squad. Make sure to stay
                         under budget when adding players!

                <p>
                For success in Fantasy Football, it's important to stay up-to-date with player form, injuries,
                 transfers, and other key news. Follow football coverage regularly to make well-informed
                decisions about your squad.

                </h3>
                <p>
                It can be tempting to fill your team with superstars, but balancing your squad is important.
                 Make sure to invest wisely in lesser-known players who offer value for money but are likely
                   to perform well.

                 3. Plan Your Transfers Strategically
                </h3>
                <p>
                Making unnecessary transfers can waste your budget. Plan your transfers around fixture
                 schedules and player performances, and save your wildcard for when it really matters.

                <p>
                Pay attention to the football season schedule. Players with favorable fixtures will have better
                chances of scoring points, so make sure to plan your squad around upcoming games.

                Your captain is one of the most important decisions each week. Pick a player with the
                highest chance of scoring points, whether it’s through goals, assists, or clean sheets.
